# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on various medical parameters using **Machine Learning** techniques. It demonstrates data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in Python.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `diabetes.csv`, which contains the following columns:

| Column                     | Description                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Pregnancies                 | Number of pregnancies                        |
| Glucose                     | Plasma glucose concentration                 |
| BloodPressure               | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)             |
| SkinThickness               | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)            |
| Insulin                     | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)              |
| BMI                         | Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction    | Diabetes pedigree function                   |
| Age                         | Age of the patient (years)                  |
| Outcome                     | 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic              |

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features)
- Training multiple Machine Learning models such as:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asmitkumar-hub/diabetes.git
cd diabetes
````

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
# Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:

   * Explore the dataset
   * Preprocess the data
   * Train and evaluate ML models
3. Predict diabetes for new input data using the trained model.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

---

## Results

* Model accuracy and performance metrics will be displayed after training.
* Confusion matrix and classification report provide insight into predictions.

If you want, I can also **make a shorter, attractive version** of this README that looks very professional for GitHub and is **ML-project specific**, highlighting results, visualizations, and model metrics.  

Do you want me to make that version too?
